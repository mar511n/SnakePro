SnakePro is a professional snake game made in Godot 4.3.
The game includes the following features:
1. Multiplayer (over IPv4)
2. In-game items such as:
    - Speed Boost
    - Shooting
    - Killer bots
    - Farts
    - Medkit
3. Game statistics & replays
4. Different playable Maps
5. Controller Support

## Installation
To run the game simply download "SnakePro.x86_64"/"SnakePro.exe" for Linux/Windows and "SnakePro.pck".
You can place them anywhere, but both files must be in the same folder.
On Android only "SnakePro.apk" is needed.

## First Steps
SnakePro is supposed to be a multiplayer game. It can be played with devices on the same LAN or over the internet (this is more complicated).

It's also possible to play on the same device with multiple Players, by opening multiple SnakePro-windows/applications.

To test the game alone, press the "join/host" button and host a game. Now the "play" button will appear.
