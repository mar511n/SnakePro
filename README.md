SnakePro is a professional snake game made in Godot 4.3.
The game includes the following features:
1. Multiplayer (over IPv4)
2. In-game items such as:
    - Speed Boost
    - Shooting
    - Killer bots
    - Farts
    - Medkit
3. Game statistics & replays
4. Different playable Maps
5. Controller Support

## Installation
To run the game simply download SnakePro_linux.x86_64/SnakePro_win.exe and SnakePro_linux.pck/SnakePro_win.pck for Linux/Windows from the executables folder.

You can place them anywhere, but both files must be in the same folder.

On Android only SnakePro.apk is needed.

To run a dedicated server, download SnakePro_server.x86_64 and SnakePro_server.pck and run it on the server.

## First Steps
SnakePro is supposed to be a multiplayer game. It can be played with devices on the same LAN or over the internet.

Either one player hosts a game (which requires an open IP-Port) or a dedicated server can be used, which players can join.

It's also possible to play on the same device with multiple Players, by opening multiple SnakePro-windows/applications and hosting/joining on the localhost ip.

To test the game alone, press the "join/host" button and host a game. Now the "play" button will appear.
